# UFO Sighting Webpage
## Teodor Anderson

## Overview
Using HTML, this webpage will use a filter form to retrieve data from a large JavaScript dataset of UFO sightings, based on areas and shape of the UFO.

## Summary
To summarize, the page is neat with bootstrap color elements applied to the text and background as well as a backdrop picture.
The JavaScript code functions correctly and quickly, allowing users to find information on UFOs neatly and quickly.
### Drawbacks
The inputs are required to be in lowercase as well as there not being any data before 2010.
### Improvements
Using or creating a large API of UFO sightings would make our webpage much more interesting, as well as auto updating the site as new sightings happen. Another would be more data in the table, such as first hand quotes of the sighting as well as how many people were present
